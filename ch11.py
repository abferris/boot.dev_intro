# Complete the remove_duplicates function. It should take a list of spells that a player has learned and return a new List where there is at most one of each title. You can accomplish this in at least two ways:
# create a second list and if the spell isn't in the list, add it, then sort it (optional use a set)

# The number of vowels in the string

# Complete the find_missing_ids function. It accepts two lists as input, and returns a new set of all the IDs that are in the first list but are not in the second.

# Naturally, there will be no duplicates in the resulting set.
